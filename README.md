# RPG-Game
This is my RPG game, written in python. I'm a newbie both at programming, and this is my first try with git and github.
This will be a game that i'll try to write perhaps in object oriented programming and probably with game design patterns, such as command pattern, observer pattern, etc. Feel free to give me tips on how to implement changes and better my programming and game. Keep in mind I'm a total newbie =) this will be an exiting project for me.
